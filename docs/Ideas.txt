Ideas:

###Multiple Racers###

PCA at every time point to see when things change? (with multiple racers)
Make biplots?

###Singular Racers###

Main problem is my data is time dependent - we haven't done this in class - i.e. observations that are not independent.

Make some sort of summary measure of training rides then use these measures
as the covariates for different observations (Average HR power cadence speed, TSS, Normalised Power)

Factor analysis based on these summary measures, relate this to underlying "fitness" - unmeasurable

Note model widespread use  Form =  fitness(CTL -weighted 60 days TSS) - Fatigue(ATL - weighted 7 days TSS)
can we do better than this?

normalised power = (mean(power^4))^(1/4)

Can I classify rides as intervals, lone rides,group rides, races ?

######Potential question to ask - Can I use factor analysis/ PCA to come up with a better measure than TSS that is not physiologically motivated.#####
###### And can this be used to predict perfomance in races better than the standard - Form = fitness  - fatigue#######?

###Long Term Goals### Requiring more data

#Races
With data from all riders on one team in a large race, can we predict:
- which breakaways will stick,
- which breakaways will win,
- what team can do to win sprint in final kms,

#Training
With one riders training data, or training data from whole team can we predict:
- what training might produce good performances from team,
- what training might produce good performances from individuals
- can we do better at predicting form than standard models.
