To predict possible performance on any one day : regularised regression on all previous workouts - since
we expect the each individual workout to have a small effect on overall fitness. Include time as a variable and 
include interactions with time for all other variables.

Do PCA on data frame with outcomes.

Do biplots with data frame with session info.

Put plots of bikes rides in report.
